My knowledge before starting the project:

Python Knowledge: Zero
Fetch.AI Agents Knowledge: Zero
Integration with AgentVerse and DeltaV: Zero
My knowledge after completing the project:

Python Knowledge: Beginner
Fetch.AI Agents Knowledge: Intermediate
Integration with AgentVerse and DeltaV: Intermediate
I completed this project on my own, feeling a bit frustrated by the lack of Brazilian participants in the AI track, but I worked hard, read through the documents, corrected GPT errors, and I believe I achieved a good result.

With no prior knowledge, I managed to code in Python. I initially struggled with local installations, only to later realize I could use AgentVerse.

I had difficulties integrating with DeltaV, but when I finally succeeded, it was an incredible moment! It was challenging, but I felt very happy to have made it work.

I finished the first version of my project in the early hours of Sunday, and I hope to refine it even more!

While it might not meet all expectations, for me, personally, it was a huge achievement!

I hope to teach others what I've learned and plan to develop more solutions using ASI agents with Solana!

Thank you for this opportunity!

HOW TO TEST*

Visit the site: DeltaV AgentVerse
https://deltav.agentverse.ai/home?functionGroupId=12c8601c-cccd-42de-a5f1-7eab76ae3121&_gl=1*ulhisc*_ga*MTc1NTQ2NzQ3OC4xNzI4NDgzODEw*_ga_0C55J9N0FX*MTcyODgxNjQxNi4xMC4xLjE3Mjg4MTY0MjMuMC4wLjA
Type "solana"
Enter the address of an ASI wallet
Enter the address of a Solana wallet
The agent will search for your NFTs and present you with a list, including the count of NFTs, the value in SOL, and the total value in dollars.

Future Roadmap:
In the future, I plan to integrate floor price monitoring and NFT buying and selling integrations.

Thank you so much!
